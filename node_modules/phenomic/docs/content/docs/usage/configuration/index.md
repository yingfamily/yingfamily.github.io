title: How to configure Phenomic
---

You have multiple things you can tweak to adjust the behavior of Phenomic to your
needs.

- [Phenomic core configuration](./core/) for built-in features
- [Webpack configuration](./build/) to adjust some build step and behavior of consumed files
  (CSS, JS, MD...)
- [``react-helmet``](./document-head/) to handle HTML head/meta of pages

Be also sure to check out the [plugins](../plugins/) section for custom needs
for files.
