title: Hot loading is not working for me, what am I doing wrong?

Hot loading might not work correctly depending on the OS, your CPU, and the location of your directory.

There is [a known issues with *Dropbox*](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic/issues/595) for example.

**So try moving your project if hot loading does not work for you out of the box.**
