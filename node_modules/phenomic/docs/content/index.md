## Easy to use

Write your content in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files (or any other text format) or directly in React.
Implement your design with JavaScript files, using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

**No template language to learn. Just JavaScript** (and JSX if you like it).

You can just grab some packages on the [NPM ecosystem](http://npmjs.org/)
to help you build your website, blog or even a small app.

_Phenomic_ will help you generate and deploy a website in a heartbeat.

## Static and dynamic

[React](http://jlongster.com/Removing-User-Interface-Complexity,-or-Why-React-is-Awesome)
is used to generate pages for both client and server; it's called ~~Isomorphic~~
[Universal rendering](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9).

A pre-rendered, *static* version of your website is generated first; then when
a user browses your website, **they can get the same UX as an app by grabbing
the minimal amount of data for each new page**
(a single file that only contains your page data).

## Choose your flavor

Phenomic is easily customizable.
You can choose your own Markdown engine ([or any other engine](/docs/usage/plugins/))
and your own
[CSS preprocessor, CSS in JS or inline styles solution](/docs/usage/styling/).

By default, Phenomic provides a
[base theme](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic/tree/master/themes/phenomic-theme-base)
that includes a recommended workflow.
It also contains commented pieces of code that allows you to quickly customize
it to fit your needs.

## Awesome DX (Developer Experience)

During development, enjoy the benefit of hot loading with visual errors in your
layout! That means you won't have to refresh your page during development when
you edit your website. You will also see compilation & runtime errors.
